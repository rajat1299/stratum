# Stratum Project Status

- Last updated: 2026-05-01
- Branch: `v2/foundation`
- Baseline merge to `main`: `72e0e4a` (`Merge branch 'v2/foundation'`)
- Current follow-up slice: CI foundation workflows

This is a living engineering status file. Keep it factual, repo-grounded, and short enough that a teammate can use it as a starting point before reading the deeper docs.

## Product Positioning

Stratum is currently best described as a versioned workspace for AI agents: durable files, search, permissions, commits, rollback, HTTP access, MCP access, and a remote-first CLI over one shared virtual filesystem.

The near-term product boundary is important:

- It is an agent workspace and control layer for inspectable agent work.
- It is not yet a general sandboxed execution platform.
- It is not positioned as a generic POSIX cloud filesystem replacement.
- The CTO direction points v2 toward a durable, POSIX-compatible, versioned agent filesystem for long-lived enterprise documents, with Rust retained as the core and TypeScript/Python SDKs added later.

Grounding:

- `README.md`
- `docs/agent-workspace-positioning.md`
- `docs/cli-cloud-bridge.md`
- `docs/execution-roadmap.md`

## Completed Foundation Capabilities

The `v2/foundation` branch has moved a meaningful part of the Phase 0 / Milestone 1 foundation into the repo.

### Filesystem And Access Surfaces

- Rust virtual filesystem core remains the product foundation.
- CLI/REPL, HTTP API, MCP server, `stratumctl`, and optional FUSE entry points exist.
- Regular file names are now allowed by default; markdown-only behavior is a compatibility mode through `STRATUM_COMPAT_TARGET=markdown`.
- HTTP API covers filesystem read/write/list/stat, search/find/tree, VCS, workspace metadata, workspace tokens, run-record creation, and run-record reads.
- MCP exposes agent file/search/versioning tools and now supports workspace-mounted scoped sessions.

Grounding: `README.md`, `docs/http-api-guide.md`, `docs/mcp-guide.md`, `src/bin/stratum_mcp.rs`, `src/bin/stratumctl.rs`.

### Auth, ACL, And Scoped Sessions

- User/group/agent-token auth exists with Unix-style permission checks.
- HTTP no longer falls back to implicit root for missing or unsupported auth.
- Scoped session prefixes are enforced centrally in `StratumDb` for reads and writes.
- Workspace bearer tokens carry persisted read/write prefixes.
- Workspace bearer sessions mount the workspace root as `/`, while enforcing backing absolute scopes.
- MCP can resolve `STRATUM_MCP_WORKSPACE_ID` plus `STRATUM_MCP_WORKSPACE_TOKEN` into a scoped non-root mounted session.
- Workspace metadata and workspace token hashes are durable in the local metadata store.

Relevant commits:

- `2f1692a` - enforce scoped API and MCP permissions
- `01aa0dc` - enforce scoped session prefixes
- `63f09fa`, `3650a31`, `67826ed` - persist, constrain, and validate workspace token scopes
- `ae61679` - issue scoped workspace tokens over HTTP
- `1420437` - support scoped workspace tokens in MCP
- `82c7bca` - persist workspace metadata

Grounding: `src/auth/session.rs`, `src/db.rs`, `src/workspace/mod.rs`, `src/server/middleware.rs`, `src/server/routes_workspace.rs`.

### VCS, Refs, Status, And Diff

- Commit/log/revert exist over content-addressed VCS storage.
- Refs foundation exists, including persisted refs and compare-and-swap style ref update behavior.
- VCS status and text diff foundations exist for human review of changed paths.
- Global VCS HTTP endpoints remain admin-gated.

Relevant commits:

- `20dd0e7` - add VCS refs foundation
- `647b93f` - add VCS status and diff foundation

Grounding: `src/vcs/`, `src/server/routes_vcs.rs`, `docs/version-control.md`, `docs/http-api-guide.md`.

## Recent Execution / Run-Record Work

Execution Phase 1 is implemented as run records only.

What is built:

- `src/runs.rs` defines the run-record model, safe run ID validation, canonical file layout, metadata rendering, and tests.
- `POST /runs` creates durable run artifacts in a mounted workspace under `/runs/<run-id>/`.
- `GET /runs/{id}` reads the durable run record summary, including file metadata and bounded content previews.
- `GET /runs/{id}/stdout` and `GET /runs/{id}/stderr` return raw captured output content.
- Standard files are:
  - `prompt.md`
  - `command.md`
  - `stdout.md`
  - `stderr.md`
  - `result.md`
  - `metadata.md`
  - `artifacts/`
- `POST /runs` requires workspace-mounted bearer auth plus `X-Stratum-Workspace`.
- `POST /runs` accepts optional `Idempotency-Key` values. Same-key retries with the same workspace, agent UID, and normalized request body replay the original completed `201 Created` JSON response with `X-Stratum-Idempotent-Replay: true` and do not create another run directory.
- Idempotent run-create replays still validate the current workspace token's run write scope before returning the stored response.
- Run reads require workspace-mounted bearer auth plus read scope for the backing workspace `/runs/<run-id>` path.
- Plain user auth and global bearer sessions are rejected for run creation.
- Supplied run IDs are restricted to ASCII letters, digits, `_`, and `-`; omitted IDs are UUID-based.
- Duplicate run IDs are rejected with `409 Conflict` and do not overwrite existing records unless the request is a matching idempotency replay.
- Idempotency-key reuse with a different request fingerprint returns `409 Conflict` without mutation; invalid idempotency keys return `400 Bad Request` before mutation.
- Writes are scoped through the existing workspace token boundary.
- Success, replay, and error paths are projected back to workspace-relative paths and should not leak backing workspace paths.
- Oversized run file payloads are rejected before creating the run root.
- Phase 1 is explicitly not transactional across all files if a later write fails.

What is not built:

- No command execution.
- No scheduler or queue.
- No stdout/stderr streaming.
- No cancellation.
- No sandbox policy.
- No automatic commit or review workflow around a run.

Relevant commits:

- `5b920d7` - plan run records foundation
- `6e7e47b` - add run record model
- `a40e18c` - harden run record model
- `e0cc8ab` - create workspace run records over HTTP
- `20b560f` - harden run record creation
- `3f8f02c` - format server route module
- `5f14348` - plan run status API
- `08ac155` - add run status model
- `3ac58fe` - read workspace run records over HTTP

Grounding: `docs/execution-roadmap.md`, `docs/http-api-guide.md`, `docs/plans/2026-04-30-run-records.md`, `src/runs.rs`, `src/server/routes_runs.rs`.

The follow-on run status/read API slice has landed against `docs/plans/2026-04-30-run-status-api.md`.

Current status model states are `queued`, `running`, `succeeded`, `failed`, `cancelled`, and `timed_out`. New run records default to `queued` unless imported or externally managed run data provides a specific status.

## CI Foundation

The CI foundation slice adds GitHub Actions workflows for the checks that should protect normal branch and pull-request work.

What is built:

- `.github/workflows/rust-ci.yml` runs on pull requests and pushes to `main` and `v2/**`.
- The default CI gate uses least-privilege `contents: read` permissions.
- Default CI jobs run formatting, clippy with warnings denied, non-perf tests, optional `fuser` compile, and `cargo audit --deny warnings`.
- `.github/workflows/rust-perf.yml` runs the release-mode perf suites only through manual dispatch and a weekly schedule.
- Rust formatting and clippy cleanup is committed separately from workflow wiring so future CI failures are easier to attribute.
- The audit gate is green without advisory ignores: the direct `bincode` dependency was replaced with a local `serde-wincode`/`wincode` codec wrapper, and `aws-sdk-s3` features were narrowed away from the legacy rustls connector path.

What is intentionally not in the default PR gate:

- Release-mode perf tests, because they are longer-running signal and should not block every normal PR by default.

Grounding: `.github/workflows/rust-ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/rust-perf.yml`, `docs/plans/2026-05-01-ci-foundation.md`.

## Verification Status

Verified on 2026-04-30 from this worktree:

```bash
cargo test --locked
```

Result: passed.

Observed coverage in that run included:

- `src/lib.rs` unit tests: 120 passed.
- `stratum_mcp` unit tests: 8 passed.
- `stratumctl` unit tests: 1 passed.
- integration tests: 131 passed.
- perf tests: 37 passed.
- perf comparison test: 1 passed.
- permission tests: 72 passed.
- doc tests: 0 run, passed.

Additional focused verification after adding the run status model:

```bash
cargo test --locked runs::tests -- --nocapture
```

Result: passed, 17 tests.

Additional focused verification after adding run create idempotency:

```bash
cargo test --locked server::routes_runs::tests -- --nocapture
git diff --check -- src/server/routes_runs.rs docs/http-api-guide.md docs/project-status.md
rustfmt --edition 2024 --check src/server/routes_runs.rs
```

Result: passed, 26 route tests; diff check and rustfmt check passed.

CI foundation verification uses the same command set as the default workflow plus the optional FUSE compile and security audit:

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --locked --lib --bins
cargo test --locked --test integration --test permissions
cargo test --locked --doc
cargo check --locked --features fuser --bin stratum-mount
cargo audit --deny warnings
git diff --check
```

Result on 2026-05-01: passed from this worktree. Observed coverage included 153 lib tests, 8 MCP unit tests, 1 `stratumctl` unit test, 131 integration tests, 72 permission tests, 0 doc tests, optional `stratum-mount` FUSE compile, and `cargo audit --deny warnings` scanning 387 dependencies with no denied findings.

## Known Residual Risks

- Local durability is still file-backed metadata/state, not the CTO-plan target of Postgres metadata plus S3/R2 object storage.
- Scoped ACL enforcement has broad tests now, but the long-term policy service, action capabilities, policy decision logging, and tenant isolation model are not built.
- Refs/status/diff are foundation-level; full branch/session semantics, merge policy, protected refs, and approval workflows are not complete.
- Run records are useful audit artifacts, but they do not prove safe execution because no runner or sandbox exists yet.
- Run-record creation is not fully atomic across all files.
- Search remains a filesystem/search surface, not the full-text plus semantic derived index described in the v2 plan.
- No production audit event stream exists for every auth/read/write/commit/approval/revert action.
- Cloud deployment scaffolding exists, but production multi-tenant backend, observability, broader idempotency coverage, KMS/secrets posture, and private-beta hardening remain future work.

## Not Built Yet

From the CTO plan and current repo docs, these are the major missing v2 pieces:

- Durable cloud backend: Postgres metadata, S3/R2 object store, idempotent object upload, atomic ref updates.
- Repo/session domain model beyond the current workspace/ref foundation.
- Change requests, approvals, protected refs, protected paths, merge/reject/revert review flows.
- Full audit event pipeline.
- TypeScript SDK and Python SDK.
- Remote sparse FUSE mount with cache correctness guarantees.
- Full-text extraction workers and ACL-aware semantic search.
- Web console for browsing, diffs, approvals, audit, and access management.
- Execution Phase 2+: job runner, lifecycle status transitions, output streaming, cancellation, timeouts, sandbox policy, and artifact limits.

## Recommended Next Slices

Recommended order, keeping risk and the CTO plan in mind:

1. Tighten VCS/session semantics: create/list/update ref API, session refs, compare-and-swap update guarantees, and clearer workspace-to-ref ownership.
2. Add audit-event scaffolding for mutating operations, even if initially local/file-backed.
3. Add idempotency keys for write, commit, and workspace-token endpoints.
4. Finish the run status/read API review and full verification pass before any runner work.
5. Define the change-request/protected-path API contract before implementing approval workflows.
6. Start cloud storage abstraction work behind the existing local backend rather than rewriting the Rust core.

## Branch And Release Status

- Branch: `v2/foundation`.
- Remote tracking branch: `origin/v2/foundation`.
- `main` and `v2/foundation` were synced and pushed at merge commit `72e0e4a` after the run creation idempotency slice.
- `v2/foundation` now contains the CI foundation slice after that merge.
- This branch appears to be foundation work, not a release branch.
- No release tag or packaged v2 artifact was identified during this status pass.

## Updating This File

Update this file whenever a meaningful slice lands or a major assumption changes.

Suggested update rules:

- Change `Last updated`, branch, and HEAD when updating status.
- Add new completed slices with file and commit references.
- Move items from "Not Built Yet" into completed sections only after code and tests land.
- Keep verification factual: include exact command, date, and pass/fail result.
- Keep roadmap statements tied to repo docs, the CTO plan, or committed code.
- Do not use this file for speculative product claims or external market claims.
- Keep it concise; link to deeper docs instead of duplicating them.
